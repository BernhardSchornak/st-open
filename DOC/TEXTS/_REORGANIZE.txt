     REDESIGN OF ST-OPEN LIBRARIES
     =============================

     - OnLine Help uses one subfield for each language. Entries are interleaved:
       Title-Text-Title-Text...

     - Support for 16 languages per language field FFFFFF12, FFFFFF13, FFFFFFF5,
       FFFFFFF9, FFFFFFFA, FFFFFFFB.

     - A new language field FFFFFFF8 was added. It replaces the language entries
       currently kept in SystemStrings. This enables DatTools to access language
       names without contortions and keeps SystemStrings as small as possible.
       Actually, 64 entries are sufficient if an application does not use System
       Strings as storage for application data.

     - System data fields are moved from SYST to DATA. It simplifies the Loader,
       because it does not have to distinguish between system and default fields
       while allocating or freeing fields. d2hex() is faster than copying parts
       of the name and assembling them.

     - NUM.DAT is extended, and CVT.DAT is added to NUM.DAT's permanent storage.
       The permanent storage area is extended to 30,720 byte, while the new run-
       time area occupies the remaining size of the new 65,536 byte block. This
       reduces the need for system functions to allocate additional memory. All
       data currently stored in a program's .RDATA section can be outsourced to
       the new system area and can be accessed from everywhere without the need
       to declare .RDATA regions as global variables.

       All language fields now are stored in LANG. This new subfolder holds six-
       teen subfolders 00 - 0F. Each holds language fields for the corresponding
       language set. If more than 16 translations are available, the menu should
       be expanded with a 'more' entry as the last item of the language submenu.
       Selecting this 'more' item pops up a listbox with all languages stored in
       field FFFFFFF8. When a language is chosen, the language manager loads the
       corresponding language set - the chosen language's fields just are copied
       over the existing language fields. Selecting the proper folder is as easy
       as shifting the selected language number right by four - the upper nibble
       is the number of a subfolder within LANG, the lower nibble determines the
       language within the chosen language set.

     - To simplify evaluation and output of strings, the libraries are re-coded
       to use UTF-16 instead of ASCII. Even if all strings grow twice as large,
       UTF-16 speeds up conversions and string functions markably. Word-aligned
       data are faster accessible than their byte-aligned counterparts.

     permanent
     ---------

     0000 - 01FF   system  data   (remains)
     0200 - 1FFF   program data   (expanded)
     2000 - 3FFF   conversion tables (2E00 - 2FFF user table)
     4000 - 77FF   lookup tables and structures currently stored in RDATA

     runtime
     -------

     7800 - 7FFF   system  data
     8000 - FFFF   program data



     Languages
     =========

     Up to 240 languages can be stored in up to 16 language sets. English is the
     most common language worldwide, so each set has English as default language
     number zero. This enables a user to switch the menu from an unreadable pre-
     selected language to English, then to select her/his native (or best known)
     language from the language selection submenu.

     Language fields are stored in the LANG subfolder of a program's main folder.
     Depending on the amount of tranlations, subfolders 00...0F residing in LANG
     hold all data fields with translations belonging to the corresponding set.

     Whenever a user switches to a language belonging to another set, the fields
     of the current set are copied back to their folder, then the new fields are
     copied to DATA. The new set now is the working set, supporting up to 16 new
     languages.

     Languages are managed by DatTools - whenever a new language is added to the
     pool, DatTools automatically create a new set if the last set was filled up
     by the previous language. {TRANSLATION}{LANGUAGES} is the only dialog where
     all available languages are shown together. All other dialogs work with the
     currrently loaded set. To translate from/to a language in another set, it's
     required to switch to the set with the desired language. If the set already
     is filled up, it is possible to copy (clone) its content to a free subfield
     of another language set to translate it there.

     To avoid inconsistent 'language salad', new languages have to be registered
     before they can be assigned. If a program does not provide translations for
     some registered languages, all -not- translated languages in field FFFFFFF8
     must be deleted. A deleted language name must be restored before the trans-
     lation for that language is added.
