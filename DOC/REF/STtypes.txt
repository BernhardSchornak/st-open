     This file contains all types defined for the ST-System. FDacc() doesn't recognise
     other types because it does not know anything about them.

     Please *NEVER* define data types on you own. If you think a data type is missing,
     drop me a note. I might consider to expand the DBE if you can convince me why the
     data type you need is *that* important.
