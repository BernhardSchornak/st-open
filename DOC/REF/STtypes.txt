     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     This file contains all types defined for the ST-System. FDacc() doesn't recognise
     other types because it does not know anything about them.

     Please *NEVER* define data types on you own. If you think a data type is missing,
     drop me a note. I might consider to expand the DBE if you can convince me why the
     data type you need is *that* important.

     The DBE does not distinguish between signed and unsigned data types. -Any- stored
     data are treated as unsigned integers, including dynamic strings. If you use math
     functions FDA_INC, FDA_DEC, FDA_ADD, FDA_SUB, you have to validate the results on
     your own - the DBE neither cares about overflows nor does it perform range tests.
     All math operations are precise within the valid range, but the MSB gets lost for
     all operations throwing  2e(n+1) bit  results for  2e(n) bit  data.
