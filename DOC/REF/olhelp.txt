          This file contains all numbers defined for internal help texts in the system.

          Please use numbers equal to or above USER 00 to avoid collision with system's
          internal OLH calls. If you ignore this hint, internal functions might display
          help texts written for your program 'cause you overwrote system texts or your
          dialog displays help written for a system dialog.

          Expand field FFFFFFFB if you need more than seven help texts. DatTools copies
          all system help texts from its own FFFFFFFB to the newly created FFFFFFFB. It
          is recommended to update DatTools' DATA folder whenever new system fields are
          published!
