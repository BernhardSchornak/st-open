<h1>ST-Open Libraries</h1>
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<h2>Version 8.0.0.</h2>
ST-Open libraries version 8.0.0. are designed for Windows (64 bit). To run the executables, a
 64 bit version of Windows is required. The libraries still are ported from OS/2 (eCS) to 64
 bit Windows, hence, this HTML documentation is not up-to-date at the moment. The downloadable
 material provided at Google-Code is not tested, yet - it is considered to be beta software at
 the moment. Because porting the libraries and helper programs has absolute priority, you should
 not expect that the HTML documentation is fixed very soon. In any case, the documentation of
 in- and output parameters stored in the source files overrides the current HTML documentation.
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<h2>What's offered by ST-Open?</h2>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
The main (system) library includes ST-Open's database engine, ST-Open's memory management aka Loader,
 supporting 896 static and 1,024 runtime variables without an extra line of code, many data conversion
 functions, sandboxes for the most often used API functions (the sandboxes preserve ECX, EDX, R8, R9,
 R10, R11, XMM4 and XMM5 and replace the garbage delivered by the API with the original register content),
 support for easy and simple programming of Windows controls (buttons, menus, list- and comboboxes,
 extended spinbuttons, multilingual menus and dialogs, ...), a lot of useful string functions, time and
 (leap year aware) date functions and much more. Additional libraries extend the system library with
 ST-Open's file list, a DBE driven, easy to use notebook skeleton, bitmap functions controlled by the DBE,
 the MemHandle monitor, showing how many memory the Loader allocated for which data fields, a simple
 register monitor for assembler freaks, ST-Open's multilingual online help (OLH) and SecSys - ST-Open's
 security system, controlling access to restricted menus, dialogs, functions and data fields. The
 management of SecSys protected data fields is fully integrated in ST-Open's DBE and transparent to the
 user. This includes privilege level checking as well as the en- and decryption of strings.

<h3>Programs</h3>
These programs are developed and maintained at the moment:
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<a href="./st8/d/calc.htm" title="Programmer's Calculator">ST-Open Calc</a> - a slightly different calculator for assembler programmers.
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<a href="./st8/d/hddrum.htm" title="The Harddisk Drummer">HDdrum</a> - the harddisk drummer. Plays 4/4 as well as 7/4 or 9/8...
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<a href="./st8/d/hdrec.htm" title="The Harddisk Studio">HDrec</a> - the harddisk studio. A slightly different solution to mix audio sources.
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<a href="./st8/d/md5.htm" title="MakeDat 5">MakeDat 5</a> - ST-Open's toolbox for data fields used by the
 DBE. Includes all tools to create and manipulate the DBE's data fields. ST-Open's <i>Easy Translation
 Tools</i> are an integral part of DatTools since 2006.
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<a href="./st8/d/sre.htm" title="The Search And Replace Editor">SRE</a> - ST-Open's search and replace
 editor is a slightly different MLE editor. SRE supports up to 32 simultaneously loaded files, allows to
 split huge files (up to 4 GB) into handy, editable parts and puts them together after editing, converts
 binary files into editable hex dumps and re-converts edited hex dumps back to binary files and provides
 32 search and replace pairs in the MLE search function. While search patterns are restricted to single
 lines (the MLE's internal search function handles line breaks as string end), the replace pattern may
 include as many line breaks as you want. A unique feature of SRE is its global search. It provides
 searching for up to 32 search patterns in up to 256 directories. Matching text parts are replaced by the
 corresponding replace patterns. Found subdirectories are included in the search automatically, but the
 maximum amount of processed files is limited to 16,384 (expandable with larger data fields). SRE offers
 a toolbox filled with some useful extra tools: A <i>text module</i> chosen from a set of up to 256
 modules can be inserted at the beginning, end or current cursor position in the MLE. Up to 256
 <i>scribs</i> are available as a built in database. For example, you don't have to open the toolkit books
 to look for a structure's members any longer - just store it as a scrib. It's just three mouse clicks to
 get that information whenever you need it again. A (not finished) HTML tool finds all tags in HTML
 documents. If finished, it's thought to manage entire sites like ST-Open (> 2100 files!). The last tool
 processes GCC's <b>.s</b> files created with the <i>-S</i> option. The files are formatted properly and
 the stupid conversions from hex to decimal are undone.
<div class="crlf1"></div>
<a href="./st8/d/v8s.htm" title="V800 Program Skeleton">V800 Program Skeleton</a> - ST-Open's 'template'
for <i>your</i> next program. It includes everything you need to start programming. Oh, yes, you might
want to replace my example code with your own functions... ;)

<h2>Announcement</h2>
Please notice and accept this: I only support and maintain code and applications included in the current
 version (at the moment this is version 8.0.0.). I am busy between 18 and 24 hours per day to develop and
 upgrade the current libraries and applications. I have <b>NO</b> time to maintain stuff I wrote years
 ago. If you think you can upgrade badly coded functions with better code: JUST DO IT! Please do not
 change my code if you cannot accept the terms of the
 <a href="http://ft4fp.blogspot.com/p/ft4fp-license.html">FT4FP License</a>. Any derivates of my code
 still are subject to the terms of the
 <a href="http://ft4fp.blogspot.com/p/ft4fp-license.html">FT4FP License</a>. Recipients of copies of
 derivates of copies of my work are not allowed to pay for those derivates. Derivates must be published
 for free and without denying anyone to get a copy.
