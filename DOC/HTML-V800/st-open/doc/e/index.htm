<h1>SourceDoc</h1>
To get in touch with some important functions in ST-Open's libraries and the philosophy
 and concepts behind ST-Open's programming system, I suggest to read the
 <a href="./tut/index.htm" title="Introduction">tutorials</a> with care, before you start
 to explore the functions listed in <i>SourceDoc</i>. You might save a lot of code, sweat
 and tears if you use the functions wisely and with care. Because most of these functions
 were written for real programs, their practical use is much higher than some generalised
 functions you will find in standard libraries. With ST-Open's database engine, you get a
 powerful tool with independence from any restrictions of high level languages. ST-Open's
 core library offers e.g. access to 896 static (stored when the program is teminated) and
 1024 runtime variables without one line of extra code. Their management is invisible for
 the programmer and they can be accessed from everywhere, without passing parameters from
 one function to the other. Check it yourself. You might be astonished what less than 60
 kB of assembler code can do...
<div class="crlf1"></div>
All ST-Open functions comply to the standard C conventions, except all used registers are
 preserved on function initalisation and restored on exit. You can use all functions
 provided by ST-Open's libraries in your C or even C++ programs unhesitating to speed up
 execution a little bit. Do not expect too much, because all HLL compilers reduce any
 kind of improvements to peanuts. Caused by the small register set, HLL compilers have no
 other chance than to reload parameters from memory again and again to perform given
 tasks. The real performance boost is coming through the backdoor of HLL compilers.
 First, ST-Open's functions are ways faster than any C(++) equivalent. Second, you can
 omit redundant extra work by passing parameters in global variables. Many parameters
 never change. Storing them in global variables, we write them once, then read them on
 demand. Each global variable saves the following chain: Read parameter, PUSH it onto the
 stack, reload it again where it is required. Using a global variable saves step one and
 two. We only have to access the global variable whenever we need that parameter. If a
 function makes use of global variables instead of passing parameters, it automatically
 gains some speed.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
All functions found in Version 8.0.0. of ST-Open's libraries and all programs compiled
 against these libraries require a 64 bit processor as well as a 64 bit version of
 Microsoft's Windows operating system. Both requirements must be met if you want to run
 this software!
