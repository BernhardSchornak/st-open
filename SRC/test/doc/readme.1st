
 Test
 ====

 is a tiny program to test functions and determine how many cycles they need.

 It's probably of no practical use for anyone except me, some knowledge about
 ST-Open's libraries is required. If you want to use it, anyway:

 - Open ..\source\ttt.S with the text editor of your choice.

 - Insert your code between the both comments marked with 'XXX' lines.

 - Please do not use RDI, RSI, RBP, R10, R11 or R12. These registers are used
   by the loop logic!
