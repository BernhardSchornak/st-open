<h1>The FT4FP License</h1>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
The FT4FP project is thought to protect the rights of creative people and offers a platform to share mental "property" with
 all interested people around the globe. The FT4FP license prohibits profit oriented exploitation of mental "property" put
 under its shelter. Mental "property" never should be degraded to a propietary ware, only sold to those who have the money
 to <i>consume</i> it. As well, it is no good thing if knowledge and works of art are locked in safes, where only a small
 group of people is able to access them.
