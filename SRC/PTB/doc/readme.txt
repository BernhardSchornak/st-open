
        What is ST-PTB?
        ===============

        S stands for Schornak, T for Techniques, Transports and Tuning. Transports,
        however, meanwhile are void, while Tuning changed from engines to software.
        PTB is the short form of Programming ToolBox. it offers some handy tools to
        make a programmer's live a little bit easier:

        - A low level calculator for real programmers.

        - A calculator to determine magic numbers required to divide through multi-
          plication with a reciprocal.

        - A viewer for register dumps created with ST-Open's RegDmp().

        - A viewer for stack dumps created with ST-Open's StkDmp().

        - A viewer for memory dumps created with ST-Open's MemDmp().

        More tools are added if required. Probably, my Search & Replace Editor SRE,
        developed for OS/2, will be be merged with PTB sooner or later.

        ST-PTB is an Intelligent Design application, written in 100 % PUSH and POP-
        free assembler. Well, almost - the calculator module uses pushf to retrieve
        the content of the flag register...


        Installation
        ============

        Unzip the archive to a folder of your choice. Go down to the BIN folder and
        start ST-PTB with a doubleclick on its icon. If you have the urgent need to
        infest your desktop with one more icon, right click on your ST-PTB icon and
        use the "send to" command to create it. Please do not remove files from nor
        alter files inside ST-PTB's folders. If a datafield is missing, the program
        terminates itself. If a datafield is recognised as corrupted, it's rejected
        and ST-PTB terminates itself. If a corrupted field passed that cursory load
        tests, it might cause malfunctions and crashes (depending on the introduced
        error(s)).



        In the hope this tool is of use for the one or other real programmer
