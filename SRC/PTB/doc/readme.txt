        ============

        S stands for Schornak, T for Techniques, Transports and Tuning. Transports,
        however, meanwhile are void, while Tuning changed from engines to software.
        PTB is the short form of Programming ToolBox. offering a few handy tools to
        make a programmer's live a little bit easier:

        - A viewer for register dumps created with ST-Open's RegDmp().

        - A viewer for stack dumps created with ST-Open's StkDmp().

        - A viewer for memory dumps created with ST-Open's MemDmp().

        - A low level calculator for real programmers.

        - A calculator to determine magic numbers required to divide through multi-
          plication with a reciprocal.

        More tools are added if required. Probably, my Search & Replace Editor SRE,
        developed for OS/2, will be be merged with PTB sooner or later.

        ST-PTB is an Intelligent Design application, written in 100 % PUSH and POP-
        free assembler. Well, almost - the calculator module uses pushf to retrieve
        the content of the flag register...


        Installation
        ============

        Unzip the archive to a folder of your choice. Go down to the BIN folder and
        start PTB (just doubleclick on its icon...). If you have the urgent need to
        infest your desktop with one more icon, right click on your ST-PTB icon and
        use the "send to" command to create it. Please do not remove files from nor
        alter files inside ST-PTB's folders. If a datafield is missing, the program
        terminates itself. If a datafield is recognised as corrupted, it's rejected
        and PTB terminates itself. If a corrupted field manages to pass the cursory
        load tests, it will cause malfunctions and might even crash PTB - depending
        on the introduced error(s)...



        In the hope this tool is of use for the one or other real programmer
