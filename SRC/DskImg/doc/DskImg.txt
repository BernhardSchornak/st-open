
        D s k I m g
        ===========

        ...is a 64 bit program:

        - You need a 64 bit processor to run it.
        - You need a 64 bit version of Windows to run it.
        - DskImg denies to work on 64 bit processors without SSE2 support.



        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

        When you read this file, you already unzipped DskImg.zip. That's all -
        no further installation steps required.

        Move your DskImg folder to a drive/folder of your choice. Windows tends
        to store files at obscure locations, where no sane person -ever- stored
        executables...

        Read the HTML documentation to get in touch with DskImg.



        Usage
        ~~~~~

        Open the BIN subfolder, then double-click on the program icon to launch
        DskImg.

        - If you have no 64 bit processor, the program crashes with an "unknown
          opcode" message.

        - If your processor does not know SSE2 instructions, a message box will
          pop up. Click OK to terminate DskImg (and upgrade your machine to run
          this program).

        Choose a language via [Program][Languages]. Currently, only English and
        German translations are available.

        Read the HTML documentation if you do not understand what those options
        are good for.



        About DskImg
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        DskImg is written in 100 percent PUSH and POP free AT&T style assembler
        (Intelligent Design), using ST-Open's Libraries (e.g.: database engine,
        memory management, WINAPI wrappers, et cetera). If you can do something
        faster or more reliable: Suggestions always are welcome!



        Fakes (aka FAQs)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Q   ?

        A   No.



        Q   Why is there no 32 bit version available?

        A   For the same reason as there is no punch card or mechanical version
            - they are outdated.



        Q   Can I delete those folders except BIN?

        A   Partially. All files residing in 'DATA' are required. If you do not
            want to recompile the sources, you can delete 'SOURCE' and 'TEMP' -
            a working copy of DskImg always can be found in BIN.



        Q   DskImg denies to work!

        A   Go to the top of this file and read it. If all requirements are met
            - send me an e-mail with a detailed report.

            If you (accidentally/intentionally) deleted a data field in 'DATA':
            Unzip DskImg, again. If you know what you're doing, you can extract
            the missing data field to 'DATA'. Depending on the data field, some
            of your settings and selections might get lost.
